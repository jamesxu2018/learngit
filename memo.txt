How to pull/push w/o type credential every time?

Solution1：
Use https but keep the credentials as below
edit the .gitconfig,add section as below
[credential]
helper = store

Do a push/pull once to store the credential

It will store the credential as below, so we will not be asked to input credential in future

C:\Users\哥\.gitconfig
C:\Users\哥\.git-credentials
https://jamesxu2018:g2G1z8mf@github.com

Solution2：
Use git directly
Note: if you ever use https, remove it first

git diff --cached compares the stage and last commit, the purpose is to make sure current commit is suitable
